#### Libraries and Constants
- **Libraries:** Includes the necessary libraries for the HTS221 sensor and standard C++ algorithms.
- **Constants:** Defines pin assignments (`sensorPin1`, `sensorPin2`, `sensorPin3`), LED pin (`LED`), and threshold values (`HB`, `SB`, `EP`).
- **Global Variables:** Initializes variables for sensor readings (`v_R1`, `v_R2`, `v_R3`), thresholds (`Th_voltages`, `Th_voltage`), and communication parameters.

#### Setup Function (`setup()`)
- Begins serial communication and initializes the HTS221 temperature and humidity sensor.
- Halts program execution with an error message if sensor initialization fails.

#### Loop Function (`loop()`)
- Calls `DiversityGainEngineInit()` repeatedly to initiate the diversity gain engine process.

#### Diversity Gain Engine (`DiversityGainEngineInit()`)
- Iterates through a loop (`BITLENGTH` times) to read sensor values (`v_R1`, `v_R2`, `v_R3`) and estimate threshold voltages (`Th_voltages`) using `ThresholdVoltageEstimator()`.
- Calculates an average threshold voltage (`Th_voltage`) from the collected data.
- Calls `CombiningTEchniqueSelection()` to determine and execute a combining technique (`EGC`, `MLC`, or `SC`) based on the highest detected signal strength.

#### Threshold Voltage Estimation (`ThresholdVoltageEstimator()`)
- Determines the maximum value among three sensor readings (`v1`, `v2`, `v3`) to estimate the threshold voltage.

#### Combining Technique Selection (`CombiningTEchniqueSelection()`)
- Evaluates the effectiveness of different combining techniques (`EGC`, `MLC`, `SC`) based on sensor readings.
- Selects the technique with the highest signal strength (`CT_ID_EGC`, `CT_ID_MLC`, `CT_ID_SC`) and calls the corresponding function (`EGC_machine()`, `MLC_machine()`, `SC_machine()`).

#### Communication and Machine Functions
- **EGC Machine (`EGC_machine()`):** Implements error correction and detection using the EGC (Exclusive-OR Gate Combination) technique.
- **MLC Machine (`MLC_machine()`):** Implements majority logic combining technique.
- **SC Machine (`SC_machine()`):** Implements selection combining technique.
- **Data Processing:** Each machine function processes sensor data to determine communication modes and handles data transmission.

#### Utility Functions
- **Write Byte (`writeByte()`):** Converts a decimal value to binary and sends it bit-by-bit to output pins.
- **Pulse Mapping (`PulseMapping()`):** Controls LED to indicate data transmission status based on temperature data.

#### Supporting Functions
- **EGC_Engine(), MLC_Engine(), SC_Engine():** Functions implementing respective combining techniques with different bit processing logic.
- **`inRange()`:** Checks if a value falls within a specified range.

#### Overall Purpose

- It likely serves as part of a larger system for data transmission or control in an embedded environment like Arduino.
- Modifications can be made to tailor the code to specific application requirements.
- **Application Context:** Designed for robust sensor data processing and communication in an Arduino, stm32 or any other environment.
- **Functionality:** Implements diverse combining techniques (EGC, MLC, SC) to ensure reliable data transmission or control.
- **Feedback:** Provides visual feedback through an LED to indicate transmission status based on temperature data.
